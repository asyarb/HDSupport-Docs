The latest version of **HDSupport** is currently developed under the following technology stack:

-   Apache.
-   MySQL with phpmyadmin as the DBMS.
-   PHP 7 with mysqli prepared statements.
-   **React** for the view layer/front-end.

These docs assume familiarity with the above technologies. If you plan to continue development or add features to HDSupport, it is highly recommended that you become familiar with all of the above before beginning development.

That being said, it is not technically a requirement to utilize **React**. Additional pages can be added via standalone PHP/HTML files if you prefer. However, you would lose the benefit SPA's and the benefits (client-side routing, state management, etc.) it comes along with.
